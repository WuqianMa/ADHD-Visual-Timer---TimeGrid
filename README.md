## Overview

ADHD Friendly Timer is a simple desktop application built with Python and Tkinter. It helps users visualize the passage of time using a grid of mini-squares that gradually fill from black to whiteâ€”making time easier to perceive for those with ADHD.

## Features

- **Visual Timer:** A grid (default 20x20) of mini-squares fills as time elapses.
- **Customizable Duration:** Set the timer in minutes (defaults to 25 minutes if left empty).
- **Control Buttons:**
  - **Start:** Begin or resume the timer.
  - **Stop:** Pause the timer.
  - **Clear:** Reset the timer and grid.
- **Modern UI:** Minimalistic dark-themed interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (Tkinter is included)
- [Optional] PyInstaller (for creating an executable)
